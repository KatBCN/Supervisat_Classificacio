Sprint 10 - Task 1 - Classification

Due to the length of the exercise and the number of different steps involved, I have created 4 notebooks. There is one notebook for pre-processing of the dataset, and 3 notebooks for the 3 different classification models used.

Practice and become familiar with classification algorithms.

Level 1
- Exercise 1
Create at least three different classification models to try to best predict DelayedFlights.csv flight delay (ArrDelay). Consider whether the flight is late or not (ArrDelay> 0).

- Exercise 2
Compare classification models using accuracy, a confidence matrix, and other more advanced metrics.

- Exercise 3
Train them using the different parameters they support.

- Exercise 4
Compare your performance using the traint / test or cross-validation approach.


Level 2
- Exercise 5
Perform some variable engineering process to improve prediction


Level 3
- Exercise 6
Do not use the DepDelay variable when making predictions
